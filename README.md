# yanbapp-api

Little budget app backend. It is working but quite some features are missing. It is largely based on the YNAB Budgeting app.
There is the companion frontend application found at https://github.com/crazyfacka/yanbapp-web

## Running notes

When running the application, it starts by reading configuration from a Consul agent.
